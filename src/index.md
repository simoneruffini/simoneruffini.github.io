Hi!

I'm a computer science student at [DISI UniTn](https://www.disi.unitn.it/). 

My interests are low level programming, embedded systems, FPGAs and everything that is hardware related.  

Currently I'm a developer at [Eagle Racing Team](http://www.eagletrt.it/) working on the Battery Management System for our second and new elctric car.

I love vintage and clicky keybaords (❤️⌨️ )

If you have any question about me or else, just send an e-mail.
