Hi!

I'm a computer science student at [DISI UniTn](https://www.disi.unitn.it/). 

My passions involve low level programming, embedded systems, FPGAs and everything that is hardware related.  

Currently I am the project manager for the High Voltage section of [Eagle Racing Team](http://www.eagletrt.it/) developing the Battery Management System for the new elctric car _fenice_.

If you have any question about me or else, just send an e-mail.
